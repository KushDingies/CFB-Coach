**College Football Coach: Playcalling Edition**

This is an expansion of Antdroidx's expansion of /u/jonesguy14's College Football Coach android game. My intention is to take the amazingly in depth base provided by them and add in a playcalling feature, to increase in-game strategy and make playing games more exciting.

Forked from https://github.com/antdroidx/CFB-Coach/
All credit for all previous work goes to Antdroidx and /u/jonesguy14! This would not have been possible without the fantastic base that they provided to work on.

_Implemented Updates/Features (so far):_

**[General]**
* User games now show a dialog that allows the user to watch a game's progression play-by-play, rather than simulating the full game and then showing the results to the user

_Planned Updates/Features:_

**[General]**
* Give user a choice to just revert to old functionality and just automatically simulate an entire game instead of going play-by-play
* Another dialog box within the ingame dialog that allows the user to pick the next play


**[Game Simulation]**
* Make different play calls have different strategic bonuses, similar to the current "strategy" system but on a play-by-play basis. e.x., call a blitz to increase the chances of a sack, tell the defense to expect a run, call a specific passing play to target a specific speedy receiver, call a draw play if you think the defense will expect pass, etc.
