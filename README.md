**College Football Coach: Playcalling Edition**

This is an expansion of Antdroidx's expansion of /u/jonesguy14's College Football Coach android game. My intention is to take the amazingly in depth base provided by them and add in a playcalling feature, to increase in-game strategy and make playing games more exciting.

Forked from https://github.com/antdroidx/CFB-Coach/
All credit for all previous work goes to Antdroidx and /u/jonesguy14! This would not have been possible without the fantastic base that they provided to work on.

_Implemented Updates/Features (so far):_

**[General]**
* User games now show a dialog that allows the user to watch a game's progression play-by-play, rather than simulating the full game and then showing the results to the user
* Another dialog box within the ingame dialog that allows the user to pick his next play, and also displays the details of that play

**[Game Simulation]**
* Make different play calls have different strategic bonuses, similar to the current "strategy" system but on a play-by-play basis. e.x., call a blitz to increase the chances of a sack, tell the defense to expect a run, etc.

_Planned Updates/Features:_

**[General]**
* Give user a choice to just revert to old functionality and just automatically simulate an entire game instead of going play-by-play.

**[Game Simulation]**
* Add more play options, with more different effects and tradeoffs. E.x.,call a specific passing play to target a specific speedy receiver, call a draw play if you think the defense will expect pass, etc.
* Currently the computer team still just functions like before, without the benefits of the new play system. Eventually the computer will also randomly select plays, and the player will be given hints as to which play the computer has picked. E.x., when you're picking a play on offense, there will be a box that says things like "the safeties are cheating forward", or if you're on defense, it might say "the offense has 4 receivers out".
* The user might also be told specifically when he picked the right play. For example, if calling a blitz resulted in a sack when otherwise the QB would have escaped, it might say something like "Good playcall! The blitz got to {QB} just in time."
